= LADISH

LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management system
for https://jackaudio.org[JACK] applications on https://kernel.org/[GNU/Linux].
Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio programs running
at once, to save their setup, close them down and then easily reload
the setup at some other time. ladish doesn\'t deal with any kind of
audio or MIDI data itself; it just runs programs, deals with
saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects JACK ports together.

LADI Session Handler was forked from the
https://lac.linuxaudio.org/2009/cdm/Thursday/02_Alasuutari/02.pdf[D-Bus-ified LASH project].
Things that LADISH can do but LASH (D-Bus-ified or not) cannot:

* subgraph management, that is Studio & Rooms concept,
   which allows to decouple projects (loaded in a Room) from
   hardware audio IO used in particular Studio.
   A virtual jack-multicore cable connects room IO ports
   to hardware IO ports.
 * Suppport for apps that don\'t link to liblash.
   This is known as L0 in LADISH.
 * Seamless handling of apps using ALSA sequencer ports.
   This is achieved by use of a2jmidid and libalsapid.so.
   The former which creates jack-midi ports for the alsa sequencer ones.
   The latter reports the alsa application process ID to ladishd,
   so that ladishd can associate the a2jmidid-created ports with application.

Among project future goals are:

 * Ability to move entire sessions between computers,
   or post sessions on the Internet for download.
 * Saving/restoring state in multi-machine network
 * Session versioning via Git
 * https://ladish.org/nsm-proto.html[Non Session Manager protocol] support
 * https://new-session-manager.jackaudio.org/api/index.html[New Session Manager protocol] support
