= LADISH

LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management system
for https://jackaudio.org[JACK] applications on https://kernel.org/[GNU/Linux].
Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio programs running
at once, to save their setup, close them down and then easily reload
the setup at some other time. ladish doesn\'t deal with any kind of
audio or MIDI data itself; it just runs programs, deals with
saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects JACK ports together.

   or post sessions on the Internet for download.
 * Saving/restoring state in multi-machine network
 * Session versioning via Git
